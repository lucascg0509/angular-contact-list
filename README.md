Contact List with AngularJS
-----------------------------

I'm creating a webapp for save contacts in localStorage.

My purposes are:
	- [ ] The better interface
	- [ ] The better performance
	- [ ] The better user experience

But, at some time, I'm learning Angular. So I will need help by who can to teach.

If you speak portuguese, our comunication will be better. But I can understand some things in english.

Anyway, thank's for help and follow!
